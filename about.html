    <p class= "para">I have over 15 years of combined experience working in print, digital and film. I am also a digital and print producer. In addition to creating estimates and bidding jobs internally and externally, I also track, record, and process billing in conjunction with finance and/or company finance systems per accounting needs.
I've worked in the categories of pharmaceuticals both OTC and medical professional, accounting, internal communications, electronics, fashion and various retail.</p>
        <p class= "para"><strong>Print</strong></p>
        </div>
       <p class= "para">In print I have managed everything from direct mail, packaging, store displays, magazine ads posters, brochures, and billboards. I know all of the Adobe software programs used in print very well and have experience working directly in pre-press production; I even go on press runs for approval as some jobs and work directly with printers. My experience would be about 50% dealing with creatives and 50% production.
           
             <p class= "para"><strong>Digital</strong></p>
<p class= "para">In Digital work I started in the infancy of the business with static jpg banner ads and email blasts to the more recent flash banner ads, interactive displays, microsites, website builds and updates, mobile ads. I have worked directly with developers as a liaison and digital producer for ad agencies to get there creative visions executed. I am fluent in HTML5 and CSS as well as some content management systems like Drupal. I am versed in Agile management and some Agile method software but very few jobs fully embrace the agile method as most companies often prefer rigid documentation for liability purposes. I would sum up my digital experience as 70% front end and 30% backend</p>
          <p class= "para"><strong>Film/Video</strong></p>
        <p class= "para">
        In video and film I have project managed small budget & large films for commercial advertising working with producers.
Depending on the agency some jobs are heavily client facing where they can and would contact me directly versus some would be more traditionally based going through an account person or brand manager.
 <br><br>I have no preference for any particular media. Project management is the focus and all come with their unique challenges and need some specific knowledge. Overall managing and working with people is half of the required skill set. That does not change if it is print, digital or film.
